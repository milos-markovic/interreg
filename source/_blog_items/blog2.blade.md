                    The project "Social Entrepreneurship for Women from Rural Areas" co-financed through the Interreg IPA cross-border cooperation program Hungary-Serbia 2014-2020 consists of a range of mutually conditioned and carefully coordinated project activities. One of these activities is directly related to the cultivation of lavender, for which 60,000 euros were allocated from EU donor funds for the purchase of not less than 60,000 lavender seedlings. All lavender seedlings will be planted in the cross-border program area of the Interreg IPA cross-border cooperation program Hungary-Serbia for the period 2014-2020. Half of the planned seedlings will be planted in rural areas of the city of Sombor. 
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6 leading-loose">
                    This innovative project approach leads to real economic and social empowerment of women in the countryside, through a multi-year project of growing lavender and its processing. It can be the first step towards a better and safer life for femail citizens of Sombor and their femail neighbors in the surrounding areas. A project will gather at least 28 women from Bezdan, Conoplja, Backi Monostor, as well as other rural and farm settlements around Sombor. The cluster of women from rural areas is expected to exceed 50 members by the end of the project.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-loose">
                    Through this project, which is known by its acronym "Women to save", new opportunities and capacity building for the development of social entrepreneurship will be established through new innovative models for the transfer of knowledge and skills for women in rural areas, improving social and thus business opportunities for unemployed women in these areas.

                <p class="mb-6 leading-loose">
                    The model of realization of social entrepreneurship for women in the rural program area of the Interreg IPA cross-border cooperation program Hungary-Serbia for the period 2014-2020 is a combination of new institutions such as clusters of women entrepreneurs, which is in the founding phase, and direct support through planting lavender on plots owned or used by cluster members. This approach is supported by innovative solutions in the field of information and communication technologies that directly support the work of the cluster and help its growth and development.
