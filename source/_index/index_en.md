    - title: Briefly about the project
      paragraph: '<p class="mb-7 leading-loose">
        Social and economic empowerment of women from rural areas turns them into a great force for change in their community. This project will establish new opportunities and increase the capacity for the development of social entrepreneurship through new innovative models for the transfer of knowledge and skills for women in rural area in CBR, thus enhancing social, and consequently business opportunities for unemployed women from those areas.

      Lavender is a long-lasting herb with a life span of 12-15 years. Lavender farming can be done even on small backyard patch, and consequently there is no need for investing in big plantations. These small growers, joined into Serbian Lavender growing cluster (SLGC), established as social enterprise, could operate more productively since they can join efforts for promoting new products on the standard and on-line market. According to the data of Agriculture Expert Service Sombor (AESS) 96% of West Bačka territory is suitable for lavender growing.</p>

      The project aims to bring harmonized development to the whole region, since it would intensify economic cooperation and knowledge transfer, through sustainable use of existing natural resources (fertile land, favourable climate conditions). Implementation of project activities will enforce the growth of social capabilities of rural women, and special attention will be paid to incorporation in project activities of those who use social assistance. Lavender growing will present whole new line of products and services for this region and will enforce implementation of new, eco-friendly technologies for lavender processing. This will improve social position of rural women, since social empowerment will reduce stereotyping and discrimination, and at the same time improve their economic position as it will reduce unemployment rate. All those actions will lead to harmonized social and economic development of the region, and will promote CBC among women living on both sides of the border.
